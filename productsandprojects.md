### Zeppylin (Product)
Zepplyin is a flexibly licensed, collaborative [Web Of Things](https://www.w3.org/WoT/) platform, designed to bridge the gap between purely cloud based offerings like [Amazon Sidewalk](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-core/sidewalk/) and the (largely) fragmented mix of open and closed source offerings like [chirpstack](https://www.chirpstack.io/) and [tago](https://tago.io/).

It is designed to be equally comfortable in the **cloud** (running inside an [EC2 Instance](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) for example) or on the  **edge** (inside a  [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) device).

### Behavior-driven Development (BDD) for IOT (Project)       
A large US Based manufacturer of sensors/actuator that uses both proprietary and open [LPWAN](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8376) protocols in the field needed a way to validate the firmware that was running on their devices in an **end to end** fashion. They had already standardized on the [Behave](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Python Framework, as a way to add [BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) to their existing [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD) pipeline.

The team built delivered a set Behave Feature based Test [Scenarios](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html?highlight=scenarios#behave.model.Feature.scenarios), that utilize both a client (which in turn connects to the hardware device via a USB/Serial Interface) and a server (which has both HTTP and Websocket interfaces).

### Custom Lora implementation
