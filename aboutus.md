subtitle: We love what we do ! (perhaps a bit too much)
---

Zylum Consulting is made up of passionate makers and technologists, who represent at least two generations (Millenium and X). We're hoping to add some Gen Z Talent before the AI Apocalyse makes us all into 'consumers'...

Our core values are 

- Measure Twice, Cut Once
- If the code isn't unit tested, it's not ready (or even code)
- The perfect is the enemy of the good enough
- Spaghetti is good to eat, but not a great coding style

#### And finally...

- Keep It Simple, *Sensei* (much more polite than that *other* invocation) 


### Our story

The core team has been together since 2016, and represents the core engineering talent of Rare Media Company, makers of the (now defunt) bluedolphin field force automation platform.
