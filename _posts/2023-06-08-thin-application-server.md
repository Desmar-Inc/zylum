We are happy to announce the official launch of the Zeppylin project. Zeppylin is an open source, self-hosted, lightweight, and easy to use application server for IOT. It is designed to be used with the Zeppylin IOT platform, but can be used with any IOT platform that supports MQTT. Zeppylin is built on top of the [Eclipse Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) MQTT broker and the [Eclipse Paho](https://www.eclipse.org/paho/) MQTT client. It is written in Python and uses the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) web framework. Zeppylin is licensed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit/).
